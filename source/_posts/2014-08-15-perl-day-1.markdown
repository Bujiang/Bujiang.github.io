I really like to use ack(pure Perl implemented)  which is a tool like grep but it optimized for search source code and filter by easy filter by file type, it cause me became interested in Perl. 

For blog about Perl, I just want to record fragments of my learning process, it may not be suitable for others to read. Sorry for that :)

Perl, Practical Extraction and Report Language or Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister.

For the tradition, first is "Hello World!"
``` perl
#!/usr/bin/env perl
print "Hello Worlds!";
```
Perl need ";". 

61298040 and 61_298_040 are same

Octal: 0377

Hexadecimal: 0xff

Binary: 0b11111111    
``` perl
print "\lL" #outputs small l

print "\LAPPLE" #outputs apple    *: For capital use \u or \U
```
Use . to connotate two strings like "Hello"." World!"
``` perl
"fred" x 3 # will outputs "fredfredfred"; 
"fred" x (1+2) # outputs same
5 x 4 # outputs "5555"
```
scalar variable begin with $ sign
``` perl
$Bujiang = "Bujiang";
$Bujiang .= $Bujiang;  # "BujiangBujiang"
```
<= is less or equal;
>= is grater or equal
